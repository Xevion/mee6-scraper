# mee6-scraper
A scraper for the Mee6 Discord Bot's leaderboard

Simple served as an experiment with the leaderboard function of the mee6 bot. Uploading here as I try to migrate to a Github based system of projects.
Was mostly an experiment that started first with scraping using a Selenium bot (as Javascript generates the leaderboard), but then I realized pretty quickly
that an API exists for the Mee6 bot that is publicly available. I forgot if this was the same way that the javascript generates everything on the page, but I would assume so.
